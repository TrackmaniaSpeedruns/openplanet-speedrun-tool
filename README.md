# The Speedrun Plugin for Trackmania 2020

Note: this plugin requires the [PlayerState](https://openplanet.dev/plugin/playerstate) plugin in order to work properly.

This plugin integrates LiveSplit. In order to work, you need the [LiveSplit Server plugin](https://github.com/GreepTheSheep/LiveSplit.Server/releases/latest).
